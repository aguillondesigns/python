    Went over hangman
    Decided on new project 
        Contact Book Project

        Show total number of contact, maybe show first x amount

        What would you like to do
        1. Search for contact
            a. search by first name
        2. Add new contact
            a. probably should allow for blank data
        3. Edit Contact
            a. what will the edit screen look like, maybe ask them what they want to edit?
        4. Display Contacts
            a. shows all contacts

                14114 Wetmore Bend, San Antonio, TX 78247
                
                i. allow user to pick a user id to show a specific contact
        5. Remove contact
            a. probably should confirm they really want to do this
            b. how do we decide who to remove
            
        Contact
            id - users unique id to our contact system
            first name
            last name
            address
            city
            state
            zip
            email
            phone
            birthday

        Adding would save the record in some fashion, maybe csv?
